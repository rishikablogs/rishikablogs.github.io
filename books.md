# My favorite books in 2025:

1. **Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi** : I like reading graphic novels, as I find them easier to finish in a short time, and I feel I can connect to a combination of drawings and words more than to words alone. I especially like autobiographic graphic novels, narrating the author's first hand account of a challenging time. Persepolis was an endearing story of Marjane's life in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. This was my first introduction to Iranian life and history. I felt I could connect to Marjane's adolescent feelings of rebellion, seeking adventure, and exploring her identity. 

2. **What's Our Problem by Tim Urban** : This book gave me a new framework to think about politics -- one which I had always thought about in some way, but not in as clear and formalized terms as laid out by Tim in this book. He talks about high rung and low rung thinking and how it leads to similar rungs of politics. Also about how news media has evolved over the years to favour more polarizing news due to the vicious feedback loop of people being more polarized by media, and media being incentivized to publish more biased news, to cater to their extermist audience.
