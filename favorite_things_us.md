# Some things I appreciate about the US

After spending about a decade of my life in the US, I have come to like and dislike some things about this country. In this post, I want to talk about the former. My appreciation of these things does not mean that I am imlying that these things are exclusive or unique to the US. I have visited several countries, but lived in only two countries so far, so the things I have come to appreciate about this country most are the things which I did not get a chance to experience so much during my childhood in India. This is also not to say that there aren't many things that I love about India - perhaps I will list those in another post :)

1. **Public libraries**
Growing up, I have always loved reading books. As a kid, I read a lot of Enid Blyton books, which I used to buy from my local bookstores. I also loved reading Tintin and Asterix, but those used to be pretty costly for me to buy, and I mostly got them from a cousin whose parents didn't mind splurging on comic books. During my teenage years, I started realizing that buying new books every time wasn't very scalable, so I tried to find libraries in my city. I did not live in a Tier 1 city in India, so there were very few options I had, but luckily I found a decent library close to my home. I took the library's yearly subscription, which was not really cheap, but I did the Math and realized that if I managed to read 1-2 books a month, it would be worth it. I was really excited to get my hands on all the interesting books. I picked up a book called "Angels and Demons", just intrigued by the title and the synopsis, and came to love it so much, that I ended up reading all of the available Dan Brown novels within 2 months. With time, I unfortunately lost my habit of reading, and hardly read anything during my years in college in both India and the US. After moving to California for work, and being locked inside home during Covid, I had more free time on my hands, and I decided to get back into reading. I ordered many used books from eBay, but this time too, after a certain point, I started finding it a little wasteful to buy books, most of which I will not read a second time. So I tried to find libraries near me - only, this time I found so many public libraries around! I was so excited to check them out, I went straight away to the one nearest to me. I browsed the 3 floors of the library, feeling so delighted to see all kinds of books, and in many languages too. I decided I want to get a subscription, and asked the librarian to sign me up. The librarian took my address and issued me a card, and I pulled a credit card out of my pocket. The librarian was confused, so I said I will pay for the subscription with my card :) To my pleasant surprise, I was told that the pleasure of reading is available to everyone for free in public libraries! It sounds pretty obvious now, but it was a big news to me to my younger self, and I went on a mission to tell everyone about this wonderful perk. I have been a very happy member of several public libraries around me since then, and read a diverse range of books and magazines. I frequently see many little kids come to the library with their parents, and fill up their bags with several books at a time. I imagine them going back to their homes and reading them all, which brings a big smile to my face! The library members also generously donate books to the library, which others can buy for a fraction of the cost of a new book. I find the checkout system of the library truly amazing - you simply keep the pile of books at the kiosk, and it automatically dials up all the books and you can checkout with a single press of a button. It is similar to the Uniqlo checkout system, but I believe Uniqlo got it later than the libraries :P 

2. **National Parks**
I haven't been much of a nature person for most of my life. I tend to prefer exploring cities rather than nature. However, lately (over the last ~2 years), I have come to enjoy visiting national parks a lot more, as I have started taking more interest in the unique geographical aspects of these places. US has 63 national parks, spread across all the states, some having a lot more than others. Each national park is maintained meticulously by the government, a crucial part of which are the park rangers. Visiting any national park is an enjoyable and educational experience, thanks to the rich historical and geographical information, as well as tips on how to make the most of your visit, readily available at the visitor centers. The controlled commercialization of the parks has also made them quite accessible to most people, and it is fairly simple to visit them and enjoy without too much preparation ahead of time. Although, I am aware that many people do not like this commercialization, and prefer keeping the national parks raw. While the accommodation inside the parks is usually pretty expensive, there are pretty cheap camping spots available, if you plan well in advance. I have visited about a dozen of national parks so far, and have now succumbed to the pokemon collection spree of "getting 'em all" :P. You can frequently see people collecting badges of national parks they have visited in different forms - water bottle stickers, laptop stickers, car stickers, fridge magnets, stamps, etc. My mode of collection is fridge magnets <image>.

3. **Diverse food**
My family likes eating out, and we used to go to restaurants pretty much every weekend or every other weekend. We would explore new restaurants sometimes, but more often my parents preferred to exploit the 3-4 restaurants they had come to find reliably good. In terms or cuisines, the variety available to us (back then) was north indian, some south indian, indo-chinese, street food like chaat, and dominoes pizza. Cafes were a more recent development in my city, so growing up I didn't have much exposure to the snacky cafe food. This was good enough for me, and I enjoyed eating different dishes in each of these cuisines. But after moving to the US, I discovered that there are way more cuisines than I had imagined! I was slow to experiment much in the beginning, as I have always been quite picky with food. However, there weren't too many Indian restaurants in the city I was living in for my masters, so I had to expand my palette and try a few other options. I found Mexican and Italian to be reliable options, and mostly stuck to these during my time there. Moving to California was when my cullinary options exploded! There were lots of great Indian restaurants around, so I doubled down on those initially, after being deprived for 2 years. I discovered that there was so much more to South Indian cuisine than just Dosa and Idli! It's amusing that I hadn't seen so much variety of south indian food in my city in India. Gradually, after getting a little bored of eating great Indian food, I expanded my horizon to japanese, ethiopian, burmese, and thai cuisines. It was a really fun journey of exploring and figuring out my likes and dislikes. There are some things which I hated the first time (*cough* sushi *cough*), but I took the "it grows on you" advice, and realized that it did grow on me! I also found some new favorites - ramen, drunken noodles, samosa soup. The diverse population of people in California (especially in the Bay Area) gives rise to many great things, and the amazing food scene is one, if not the biggest one of them. I also want to mention the wide range of grocery stores in this region. There are several big Indian, Asian, Mexican grocery stores. I can't speak for the rest, but the Indian stores are very well stocked, and you can find almost every vegetable, spice, grains, utensils, etc which you could need for cooking an exotic recipe.
