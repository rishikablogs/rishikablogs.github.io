## Test Your Probability Intuition

Have you ever wondered how good your intuition is when it comes to probability? This interactive quiz challenges you to guess the probability distribution of various scenarios. You'll enter your estimated percentages for each outcome, and then see how close your guess was to the actual distribution.

### How it works:

1.  Read the question describing a probabilistic event.
2.  Enter your estimated probability (as a percentage) for each possible outcome.
3.  Ensure your percentages sum up to 100%.
4.  Submit your guess and receive a score indicating the accuracy of your prediction. A lower score means your guess was closer to the correct distribution!

**Note:** This quiz uses a simple scoring mechanism (Squared Euclidean Distance) to measure the difference between your guess and the correct distribution.
